# Two-Tier PhotoApp - A Cloud-Native Image Management Application

Welcome to the Two-Tier PhotoApp project. This cloud-native application provides a two-tier architecture for managing images. This README will guide you through the project's structure and key components.

## Project Overview

The Two-Tier PhotoApp is divided into several key files, each serving a specific purpose. These files facilitate image management through AWS S3 for storage and an RDS MySQL database for data management.

## Project Structure

The key files in this project include:

- **main.py:** Your program file for Part 02.
- **awsutil.py:** Functions for uploading and downloading to and from S3.
- **datatier.py:** Functions for executing SQL against a MySQL database.
- **photoapp-config.ini:** Configuration file for storing S3 and RDS information.
